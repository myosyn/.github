# Myosyn's Code of Conduct

## Changes
The code of conducts are subject to change. It can be changed thoroughly in the near feature.

## What is Myosyn
Myosyn is a group that primarily makes [Nabi](https://github.com/myosyn/nabi), [Serenity](https://github.com/myosyn/serenity), and is the parent group to [isolysm](https://github.com/isolysm).

Everything in the code of conducts sums up what we want from our community, and what you can do. 

## 1. Usage of Products
If you are, at any point, trying to fork our project, please let us know beforehand. The owners would appreciate if you let them know by pinging them.

**Any forked projects will need to abide by the following:**
* They must not be commercial (You can't profit off of the work in any way, shape, or form).
* You must use a similar license as the project maintainer.
* You agree that any and all warranty is revoked from the maintainers if you fork the project.

The reason why your project cannot profit off of our work is due to the fact that we make a total of ZERO dollars from all of our work, so we'd much rather not 
have someone profit off of our work on the community.

## 5. Reporting Misconduct
* Copyright infringement
